     <ol class="bio">
        <li>I am from Malaysia, but have been in SG for 12+ years.</li>
        <li>My father taught me my first programming language which is VB. He is a mechanical engineer who loves coding. </li>
        <li>I had no idea building a website was this complicated prior to learning HTML,CSS and JS.</li>
        <li>I always feel HDBs are much better than condominiums. I also feel public transport is better than owning a car.</li>
        <li>My wife and I met when we were studying in uni. After we met my grades went from C's to A's.</li>
        </ol>

    <h2 id="head2">About My Career</h2>
    <p class="bio"> I am an electrical engineer with 12 years of experience in operations and project management. 
        I first started my career in the marine and old and gas industry building jack-up oil rigs , FSOs and FPSOs.
        I then ventured into data centers as a project engineer specialising in DRUPS systems which are 
        generator sets with built in kinetic energy storage that servers as UPSs. Finally I moved to  ABB as
        a Site Manager working with extra high voltage transmission systems and slowly worked my way up to Project Manager.
        But I have always missed the times I spent in my childhood learning and building programs and always wondered
        why I did not choose it as my career path. I then realized right after graduating uni, due to financial circumstance
        I chose the quickest accessible and most available jobs around from then till now. Maybe now is the right time
        to finally strive for my ikigai. Only time can tell.
